Ari
===

Status: _In Progress_

Ari is a virtual machine for what might become _Ariadne IV_.

Goals
-----

 1. Simplicity (small code size, including code to compile Ari)
 2. Composability (multiple copies of Ari should be able to work together)

Inspiration
-----------

In the film [_The Queens Gambit_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80234304),
the protagonist's (adopted) mother makes a comment about chess,
as she watches her daughter play a match:
"It's so complicated."
Therefore, I am striving to make Ari _less_ complicated than chess.

Language
--------

Ari is written in C89/90 (see Goal No. 1).
