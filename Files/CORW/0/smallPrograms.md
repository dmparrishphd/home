The Critical Thing in End-User Programming
==========================================

In discussing his definitions of literacy (three distinct kinds),
which he equates to fluency, Alan Kay, in a 1987 User Group
University talk, "Emerging Trends" states:

> Creation fluency is, "in the print medium... writing....
> we expect [the] literate to be able to
> write... two pages...
> advancing a point of view and
> substantiating it in order to convince somebody.
> And this two page thing is very important
> because most people have a very diffucult time
> dealing [pages and pages] of anything---
> even for people who can write....
> So it's very important...
> to be able to express fairly complex ideas in a couple of pages.
> [Most programming] languages are terrible for
> [expressing fairly complex ideas in a couple of pages]....
> And one of the things we found out at Xerox-PARC,
> [in the 1970's],
> is that if it's a tradeoff between
> an easy programming language...
> that requires [many] pages
> of program to do something [interesting] and
> a very abstract programming language, such as Smalltalk,
> which can do many interesting things in a couple of pages,
> then it's better to teach the abstract language
> to end-users---non-programmers---
> than it is to try and teach
> the so-called easy programming language;
> Because... having the programs be very small
> allows the person to use their visual field
> as an augmentation to their short term memory,
> and that is the critical thing in end-user programming."
